title: "Load before showing..."
---

In this test, we'll wait on something loading before showing anything. But we want to find a way to show a message conditionally before that! If you turn on throttling in the browser and hard reload, you'll see that nothing is shown in place of the plot before Arquero is loaded, even though we immediately yield `undefined`.

```{ojs}
//| label: import-and-filter

import {aq, op} from "https://esm.run/arquero"

data = aq.loadCSV("penguins.csv")

viewof selectedIsland = Inputs.select(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream", "This place doesn't exist"], {
    value: "Torgersen"
  })
```

```{ojs}
//| label: filter

filteredData = {
  yield undefined

  yield data
    .params({ selectedIsland: selectedIsland })
    .filter(d => d.island == selectedIsland)
    .objects()
}

filteredData
```

Now we'll _conditionally_ show the plot. If there's no data displayed, we'll show a message instead:

```{ojs}
//| label: plot

filteredData === undefined ?
  md`Wait a few seconds...` :
  filteredData.length == 0 ?
    md`No data available for the group **${selectedIsland}**` :
    Plot.plot({
      marks: [
        Plot.dot(filteredData, {
          x: "bill_length_mm",
          y: "bill_depth_mm"
        })
      ]
    })
```
