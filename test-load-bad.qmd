title: "Error until Arquero loads"
---

In this test, we'll wait on something loading (Arquero) before showing anything. We're not doing anything special here, just using Arquero immediately. We get an error in the later cells until it's loaded, though:

```{ojs}
//| label: import-and-filter

import {aq, op} from "@uwdata/arquero"

data = aq.loadCSV("penguins.csv")
  
dataWithDate = data.derive({ date: d => op.datetime(d.year) })

viewof selectedIsland = Inputs.select(
  ["Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream", "This place doesn't exist"], {
    value: "Torgersen"
  })
```

```{ojs}
//| label: filter

filteredData = dataWithDate
  .params({ selectedIsland: selectedIsland })
  .filter(d => d.island == selectedIsland)
  .objects()

filteredData
```

Now we'll _conditionally_ show the plot. If there's no data displayed, we'll show a message instead:

```{ojs}
//| label: plot

filteredData.length == 0 ?
  md`No data available for the group **${selectedIsland}**` :
  Plot.plot({
    marks: [
      Plot.dot(filteredData, {
        x: "bill_length_mm",
        y: "bill_depth_mm"
      })
    ]
    })
```
